# SiimAcrPneumothoraxSegmentation
Kaggle comptetion. Imagine suddenly gasping for air, helplessly breathless for no apparent reason. Could it be a collapsed lung? In the future, your entry in this competition could predict the answer.  Pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt chest injury, damage from underlying lung disease, or most horrifying—it may occur for no obvious reason at all. On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-threatening event.  Pneumothorax is usually diagnosed by a radiologist on a chest x-ray, and can sometimes be very difficult to confirm. An accurate AI algorithm to detect pneumothorax would be useful in a lot of clinical scenarios. AI could be used to triage chest radiographs for priority interpretation, or to provide a more confident diagnosis for non-radiologists.  The Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) is the leading healthcare organization for those interested in the current and future use of informatics in medical imaging. Their mission is to advance medical imaging informatics across the enterprise through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. Today, they need your help.  In this competition, you’ll develop a model to classify (and if present, segment) pneumothorax from a set of chest radiographic images. If successful, you could aid in the early recognition of pneumothoraces and save lives.
